In cases where the results of an SQL query are returned within the application's responses, an attacker can leverage an SQL injection vulnerability to retrieve data from other tables within the database. This is done using the `UNION` keyword, which lets you execute an additional `SELECT` query and append the results to the original query.

For example, if an application executes the following query containing the user input "Gifts":

`SELECT name, description FROM products WHERE category = 'Gifts'`

then an attacker can submit the input:

`' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--`

This will cause the application to return all usernames and passwords along with the names and descriptions of products.
